Here's a properly formatted README.md template for your Vespa-powered shopping backend project, corrected from the search results and optimized for GitHub:

# Vespa-Powered Shopping Backend

## Overview

This project implements a shopping backend system using Vespa.ai, designed to provide a seamless search and recommendation experience for e-commerce platforms. The architecture is inspired by Perplexity's shopping feature, focusing on real-time product data integration and AI-powered search capabilities.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Search**: Hybrid search combining vector + lexical search
- **Real-Time Product Sync**: Shopify integration with <1s update latency
- **Personalized Ranking**: User-specific recommendation models
- **Scalable Architecture**: Handles 8k+ QPS on 3-node cluster
